Celebrating Proudhon's 150th anniversary of death, I decided to republish one of his richest books, Philosophie de la misère ou système des contradictions.

In order to grant an easier access to this work, I decided to use contemporary typeface -- l'Infini by Sandrine Nugue and Fira Sans by Erik Spiekermann and Ralph du Carrois -- and a greater and more common format: A4.

Of course, closed-sourced software was not relevant for this work, so I wrote my own HTML + CSS code to layout this book as properly as I can.
